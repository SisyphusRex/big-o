This program is a rewrite of the example problem in the following youtube video:
https://youtu.be/Q_1M2JaijjQ

The Problem:
For nonnegative integers n, a, b, c
find all sets (a, b, c) where n = a + b + c

The Solutions:
Alice and Bob



This program demonstrates the difference in efficiency of Alice and Bob's algorithms by
calculating machine dependent runtime and machine independent number of iterations.

The user can input an integer for n and print the results of the algorithms.
